# Musical_Notation_DetectedProject

Hello Coder,

The frequency values of the sinusoidal signals taken with 1-second recordings are found with the fourier transform. Then the musical note value is found.

With Fourier transform series, complex signal structures can be examined. With this project, the signal structure can be determined by accessing the histogram data.

See you in the next repository.
